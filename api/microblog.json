    "path": "2022/11/17/importing-tweets-into.html",
    "content": "<p>I wanted to import a bunch of tweets from my archive (mostly cat photos and a few other bits) but I didn't want to have to manually go through each tweet, copy the text and download the photos. So I wrote a script to do it for me once I had the IDs (which I got with my <a href=\"https://rknight.me/get-safari-tabs-shortcut/\">Safari shortcut</a>).</p>\n<p>One thing that had annoyed me for a while is I didn't keep a diary/note of things that happened and my thoughts during the first year of so of the pandemic but thanks to going through my archive I now <a href=\"https://toot.rknight.me/categories/covid/\">have that</a>. On a cheerier note I have a lovely collection of animals in the <a href=\"https://toot.rknight.me/categories/pets/\">pets category</a>. These additional categories were done manually (with the help of <a href=\"https://github.com/sbarex/QLMarkdown\">QLMarkdown</a>) as I couldn't think of a way to automate this.</p>\n<p>Once I had the IDs it was a case of getting the format correctly (for example, Micro.blog will fail an import with empty categories in the YAML). I was able to take ~450 tweets, convert them to markdown and <a href=\"https://toot.rknight.me/categories/imported-tweets/\">import them into Micro.blog</a>. For example, this tweet:</p>\n<img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/1d670face2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"514\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>becomes:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ndate: 2022-10-20T13:56:19+00:00\ncategories: Imported Tweets\n---\n\n&quot;You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me&quot;\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ffg6jkDXkAARD4p.jpg)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The script isn't perfect. It doesn't do anything with hashtags or usernames, nor does it check if a tweet is a reply or a retweet. The <a href=\"https://github.com/rknightuk/twitter-to-micro-blog\">project readme.md</a> has steps for using it on your own archive.</p>\n",

Update: After speaking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_gkeenan\">Keenan</a> I changed my mind about the order of the chapters.</p>\n<p>After I finished this I looked up what the controversy was about this game because I honestly didn't know what I was supposed to be angry about. Turns out it's just straight dudes being straight dudes on the internet.</p>\n<p>I loved every minute of this (despite being deeply stressed during infected sections). The traversal and stealth through areas is massively improved from the first game, the acting is incredible, and the story is just as good as the first one. I think my only complaint is about the order of the Seattle chapters. I would have preferred to play each day of the three day section alternately between Ellie and Abby (like the did for the final chapters when Ellie goes to the boat and Abby gets captured by the Rattlers). I struggled to keep in my head what was going on with Ellie on a specific day in Seattle while I was playing the same day with Abby.</p>\n<p>Naughty Dog can do no wrong at this point and I'm very interested to see what their next project is.</p>\n<p>Some interesting things I've found since completing the game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/colleenfotsch\">Colleen Fotsch</a>, a CrossFit athlete, was the person who provided the character model/scan for Abby</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/hhcpf6/as_a_gamer_without_sight_ive_completed_the_last/\">A blind gamer</a> was able to complete the game thanks to the excellent accessibility options</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StFHPnf3mQE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">This part 1 and 2 supercut</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class='photogrid'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/8a35d957e8.jpg'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/7b881ecbe6.jpg'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/c56251f417.jpg'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/1e7279d903.jpg'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/929cf97b56.jpg'>\n<img src='https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2022/e71b0211ab.jpg'>\n</div>\n",

Facebook ring a bell? How about Twitter? Thought so. Well, updating your status can get tiresome, so if you want to make life easy, and update your status on both sites at the same time, than qStatus is for you. qStatus supports multiple accounts for both networks, lets you add information such as what you're listening to, where you are or attach photos. But is it worth buying? Let's find out.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9dcf8ea4d6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for Facebook and Twitter</li>\n<li>Multiple account support</li>\n<li>Tweet what you're listening to</li>\n<li>Add photos with TwitPic or other services</li>\n<li>Geotagging</li>\n<li>Insert Twitter username into tweets</li>\n<li>Twitter trends browser</li>\n<li>Long Tweet and Tweet Shrink support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started, add your Facebook and Twitter account. Jump into settings, input your credentials and your ready to start updating. qStatus allows you to add more than one of each type of account as well. To update your status, start typing in the text box. If you want to add photos or video to your update you can either use the camera, or select something from the camera roll.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/44346f8d69.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you want to add what music you are listening to, simply press the music note icon and the artist, song title and URL will be added. The location icon can be used to either geotag your status, add a map URL or update your profile location. qStatus also includes a Twitter trends browser, URL shortening and saving of drafts. Once you've added all this extra information to your status, hit the update status button and you're done.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>qStatus does exactly what it should do and it does it well. The interface is easy to use and has all the bells and whistles, such as photo and video upload, now playing and geotagging. The ability to change the background gives users the option to personalise the app, and multiple account support is a welcome addition.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>qStatus does not offer a choice of services for video and photo upload, which might put some people off to prefer a different service to TwitPic and TwitVid, which are the defaults. The URL shortening uses qStatus's own service, which means you won't be able to track clicks on your links using a <a href=\"http://bit.ly\">bit.ly</a> API key.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>The lack of choice in terms of photo upload and URL shortening may put some advanced users off of qStatus, but as a quick and easy method of updating Facebook and Twitter simultaneously, this app is the perfect choice.</p>\n",

Read More helps with this problem.¬†Read More lets you create a reading list, save which page you are on, track how long you have been reading for and view a history of past sessions.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/0d6de0ea67.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built in timer</li>\n<li>5 different colors and styles for books</li>\n<li>Reading list</li>\n<li>Reading summary</li>\n<li>Export reading list to a csv</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of Read More is to encourage you to well, read more. So to get started, hit the plus symbol and start adding books that you are currently reading or want to read. Type in the title, author and the amount of pages. You can also choose from five colors and four textures to display the book in your reading list. After adding everything you want to read you can edit, rearrange and delete books. When you want to start reading a book, simply select it from the list and press start timer. When you've finished reading, press finish session and select which page you stopped at. Read More will then show you what percentage of the book you have read, how many pages are left as well as estimate when you will finish the book (based on the average reading speed of each session). When you have finished reading a book, it is sent to the archive. From the archive you can view every book you have read, as well as export the data to a csv file to open in your spreadsheet program of choice. Simply select the arrow in the bottom left from the archive page and a new email with the file attached will be created.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/ae0caa19a1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>Read More has a beautiful interface and is so easy to use. Adding books couldn't be simpler, the archive is exportable and the timer will continue to run (calcualting the time of exit and reopening) even if you exit the app.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few features I would like to see in Read More, one of which I feel should definitely be there as standard. The only way to add a book is by manually typing in the title and author. I would much prefer to be able to access a database of books (e.g. Amazon) and load information such as the blurb and cover image. This would make adding books easier and also make the overall experience better. The second thing I would like to see is the ability to recommend books via Twitter, Facebook or email. I always send app links, websites and other stuff directly to friends to let them know to check it out. It would be great if, when you have finished reading a book, you could email it to a friend as a recommendation.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Read More is a simple, yet excellent app. Anyone who reads a lot, or wants to, should get this app. Read More does exactly what its should do - encourages you to read more.</p>\n",

Or perhaps you want to know what album the track is from? You whip your precious iPhone out, open an app and within seconds you have your answer. Get fast and accurate results for any song you throw at it. View lyrics for the song that you just tagged. Check out YouTube videos for the song you are playing from your iPod. Add a personal library of tagged and favourite songs and MusicID really gives Shazam a run for its money. But do you need to splash out on another music tagging app? Lets find out.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/954ad27c50.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple one-click music tagging</li>\n<li>Links to YouTube and iTunes</li>\n<li>Searchable lyrics database</li>\n<li>Add songs to favourites</li>\n<li>See the most popular songs being tagged</li>\n<li>View currently playing song from your library</li>\n<li>Add tracks from your library to favourites</li>\n<li>Email found songs</li>\n<li>Location added to tagged songs</li>\n<li>All tagged songs added to 'my songs'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you first open MusicID, as you'd expect, there is a big button to tag a song you're listening to. Tap this, hold it to the speaker and the song is automagically displayed on the screen for you. No surprises there. The song info screen shows the title, artist and which album the song is from as well as the album art for the single/album. From here you have a few options; you can buy the song on iTunes, find YouTube videos, look at the lyrics, see the location of where you tagged the song, view similar songs or email the song to a friend (a link to the song, not an mp3 file in case any of you were wondering). When you tag a song, it is automatically added to 'my songs', accessible from the button on the navigation bar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/c183524cf0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The navigation bar also houses buttons for 'now playing', 'popular' and 'search'. Now playing accesses your iPod to see what song you are currently listening to (if any) and gives you information about that specific song. You can also skip to the next song in your library by tapping the status bar and using the controls that appear. The same applies to your own songs as with tagged songs; lyrics, videos, email and similar songs are all available. There is also an option to add the song to 'my songs'. If you go into my songs, you can see everything you have tagged and manually added, see only tagged songs or only manually added songs. Pressing the plus button in the right hand corner allows you to add any song from your library to your 'my songs' section of the app. The popular tab shows you the most popular songs that are being tagged at the moment. You can then see information such as lyrics and YouTube videos for each song. The final tab to talk about is search. The search function allows you to search the entire MusicID database based on artist, song or lyrics. Simply type in what you need and MusicID will come back with a list of matching results. This is great for when you can only remember a few lines of a song you heard.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/a2099a0848.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>MusicID offers everything you expect from a music tagging app and in my tests, it managed to find every song I could throw at it, including some lesser known songs. The search functionality is excellent and the similar songs option gives really good results unlike some other services. The interface is clean and easy to use and every feature is easy to find.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>When searching for lyrics, the server would occasionally timeout and I would have to come out of the app and reopen to get any results. There is also no Twitter or Facebook sharing which is something I use on a regular basis with Shazam.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>MusicID is a good alternative to Shazam or SoundHound and is priced at $2.99 which is the same as both of its competitors. If you are constantly Googling lyrics to find the name of a song I would definitely recommend buying MusicID. However, if lyrics aren't your thing, or you already have Shazam Encore or the SoundHound paid versions, this won't add much to your app arsenal. Although, now might be the time to buy it as it's on sale for $0.99. Go get yourself a bargain. Note to those outside the US: There are two versions of MusicID; one with lyrics and one without. The version with lyrics is only available in the US, so any reference to lyrics searching/viewing is only available in the US version. Despite the lack of lyrics outside the US, I would still recommend MusicID as a viable alternative to Shazam or Soundhound.</p>\n",

Email it to yourself? Add it to Evernote? Some other process? Android Froyo <a href=\"https://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/05/apple-learn-googles-android-froyo/\">already does it</a> with 'Intents' so why shouldn't us iPhone owners be able to? myPhoneDesktop aims to fill the void. myPhoneDesktop allows you to send phone numbers, text messages, photos and URLs directly to your iDevice from the web or using a dedicated client on your Mac, Windows or Linux machine. Along with the desktop or web client, you can use a bookmarklet to send information to the app as well.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/10297fc739.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with Mac, Windows and Linux</li>\n<li>Works from any web browser</li>\n<li>Send information with a bookmarklet</li>\n<li>Send phone numbers, text messages, photos and URLs</li>\n<li>Works over 3G and WiFi</li>\n<li>Push notifications</li>\n<li>Import contacts from Outlook and Apple Address Book</li>\n<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To start sending data your iPhone with myPhoneDesktop (MPD), you need to create an account within the app and choose which method of sending you want to use. The best method, in my opinion, is the desktop client. <a href=\"http://myphonedesktop.com/\">Go over to the app's website</a>, download the client for your operating system (versions are available for Mac, Windows and Linux) and then install it. The two other methods are web-based; the first is simply a pop-up window on the MPD website. Click 'run in browser', login, and start inputting your content. The second method is a bookmarklet. Again, this can be accessed and added to your favourites from the MPD website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/18b6de801b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The desktop and web-based clients work in an almost identical way. Choose phone number, text message, photo or URL and start typing or pasting content. Type a phone number and select either phone, sms, show or copy. Selecting 'phone' will send the number to your iPhone, open the MPD app and then start the phone call. The sms option adds the phone number to the recipient field in a new sms chat and the text you have written will be added to the clipboard for you to paste in. Show and copy, as you can guess, simply sends the text to your iPhone, with the latter option adding the text to your clipboard. MPD also allows you to complete the same tasks with a URL. If you want to send a photo to the app, you can either choose a file on your computer, or paste in a URL. You can choose for the app to automatically save it to your camera roll, simply show the photo or copy it to your clipboard. Whenever you send something to your device, you will receive a push notification pop-up window informing you that something has been sent. Simply press 'view' and myPhoneDesktop will open. The app will then process what you have sent and complete any tasks it needs to (save, copy to clipboard, phone a number).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/ddc222f77d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In the settings of the desktop app, you can set a keyboard shortcut to instantly send whatever is in the clipboard. You can also import contacts (although I couldn't get this to work, I kept getting an error), set the order of contacts, toggle the keyboard shortcut and a few other things. In the settings of the iPhone app you can choose from a variety of sounds for when you receive data, choose to get data manually and set actions depending on the type of data being received.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>myPhoneDesktop offers an elegant solution to a problem that is a real pain for many of us. The desktop client works perfectly, the web-client is easy to use and the data is sent almost instantly. The fact that there is a client for Mac, Windows and Linux show that a lot of effort has gone into making MPD work for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>myPhoneDesktop is a great app but I feel that a history feature might make the app ever better. What I mean by this is that everything you send to the app would be cached (or least every text message/url/phone number) so it could be accessed over and over again. This would be great if you were working on something where you needed to send multiple different sections of text over to your iPhone. Another issue I have it not being able to access my iPhone Contacts from the desktop client. Although there is support for Apple Address Book and Outlook, I don't use either of those and it would be good to be able to access other address books such as Google Contacts or MobileMe. I haven't typed a phone number to call or text for years and I'm not going to start now.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>myPhoneDesktop gives a solution to a problem that many of us just accept as an acceptable nuisance. We shouldn't need to email notes to ourselves and this app is perfect for that and much more. The fact that this can be done even when you are at a computer other than your own, via the web, really sets MPD above other apps in the same category. This is a definite must buy and won't be moving from my home screen for a long time to come.</p>\n",

Sync your iDevice. Via Wi-Fi. Yeah, that's right, wirelessly. To get started with Wi-Fi sync you need to download two apps; one for your iDevice and one for your computer. Wi-Fi Sync works with Mac OS X (Snow Leopard, Leopard) and Windows (XP, Vista, 7). You also must be on the same Wi-Fi network on both your iDevice and your computer for this app to work. Once you have downloaded and installed both apps, simply open the app on your iDevice and accept the pairing. Wi-Fi Sync will now show a message saying your device is ready to sync and it should appear on the devices list in iTunes. Now you can sync exactly like you would if you were using the USB cable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/f8ffd2f629.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Obviously, synchronisation will be slower with Wi-Fi Sync than it is over USB, so the first thing I would suggest you to do is disable backups. This can be done from the options in the desktop app. This speeds up the process no end. Also, using Wi-Fi sync will decrease battery life if you are syncing a massive amount of music, apps and video so please remember this before downloading. There is also a small problem with the desktop app, as there is no option to close it. It doesn't use a lot of memory, so this isn't a massive issue, but I am still amazed that there is no way to close it and ending the process might not even help.</p>\n<p>Overall I love Wi-Fi Sync. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and saves you the hassle of plugging and unplugging cables. It's not cheap at $9.99 and your syncs will be slower, but personally I will be using this all the time. Oh, and make sure you show your friends. They'll be impressed, I assure you.</p>\n<p>Wi-Fi Sync is available on Cydia for $9.99 and works with the iPhone, the iPod Touch and even the iPad.</p>\n",

    "title": "Review: TV Show Tracker",

    "content": "<p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/1fda0e26ef.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>If you watch a lot of TV shows, you know how difficult it can be to remember exactly when they're on. TV Show tracker solves that problem by giving you an easy to read schedule as well as suggesting shows based on what you already watch. Think of TV Show tracker as your personal assistant. But remember, it won't pick up your dry cleaning for you.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/bf2b6ef7d4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>See all past and future episodes</li>\n<li>Genius suggestions</li>\n<li>Viewing schedule</li>\n<li>Time zone correction</li>\n<li>Data available without an Internet connection once added</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To start using TV Show tracker, you need to add some of your favourite shows. Simply search for the title of the show, select it from the list and it is added to your favourites. Once you have done this for all the shows you want to track, simply hit 'done'. Each show you added has it's own page so you can swipe between them to see when the past and next episodes are. You can view information about the episode if you're interested or if you need to work out if you have already seen it or not. Flip you iPhone on it's side and you will be shown a thumbnail view of all the shows you have added.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/b5aac21a7b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you want to find something new to watch, simply shake your iPhone and TV Show tracker's 'genius' feature will kick in. You will then be shown a suggested show and can choose to either disregard it, or add it to your collection. You can do this as many times as you like and keep adding or removing shows depending on your tastes. Obviously, the more show you have added, the more accurate your genius suggestions will be. Once you have finished shaking, adding and ignoring shows, press the calendar icon in the bottom left. This brings up the viewing schedule showing the most recent episodes of all your shows, and all the upcoming ones. Clicking any of them will take you to that show's page in your library.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>Because TV Show tracker uses the database over at TVRage, there is data for every show that you could possibly think of. The genius suggestions are generally quite useful, although like genius in iTunes, you will get suggestions for show that are of no interest to you every now and again. Your favourites list is easy to add to and edit, and the viewing schedule is great for a quick look of what you'll be watching on any particular day.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>For everything good about TV Show Tracker, one problem really stands out as something to completely turn me off this app. The searching is ridiculously slow and results can sometimes take up to a minute to show. Now I assume that this is probably a problem with the TVRage database, but this really lets the app down.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>If the searching was faster I would be recommending this app to everyone who watches TV. The interface is nice, information is easily accessible and the schedule is great. But you have to get past the slow searching to really enjoy this app. It's a shame that something as simple as search lets down an otherwise great app.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/558d04ea6f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>How to Cook Everything is the iPhone app version of Mark Bittman's award winning book of the same name. There are over 2,000 recipes and 400 how-to illustrations available, as well as a built in timer, search function and grocery list.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9598b1082a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 2,000 recipes</li>\n<li>400 how-to illustrations</li>\n<li>Advanced search</li>\n<li>by ingredient, type and technique</li>\n<li>Favorites</li>\n<li>Grocery list</li>\n<li>Built in timer</li>\n<li>Recipe of the day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first time you open the app, it will take a few more seconds than usual as it needs to index all the recipes. Once this is done you can get on with finding great recipes. The home page has five tabs, starting with the home tab. The home tab offers a 'kitchen basics' button which offers ingredients, equipment and techniques for you to be able to get your kitchen, and your cooking skills, ready for creating amazing meals. The next prominent button is the browse button, which allows you to browse through all the recipes by category. The categories are also split into subcategories (e.g. Soups&gt;cold soups). Each recipe has four icons next to it to indicate the cooking time and type of dish; fast, make ahead, vegetarian and essential. If you find a recipe you really like, you can add it as a favorite as well as vote for it. Favorites are available from the tab at the bottom and voting increases a recipes ranking in the most popular section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/fc6246db54.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>How to Cook Everything also offers collections of recipes to try out. Some of these recipes include, 'Bittman's Picks,' which includes a top 100 from each of the sections (fast, essential, make ahead and vegetarian). Most Popular offers a list of the highest rated recipes, and featured recipes offers a different recipe each day for you to try out. The quick dinners section offers a collection of recipes that fall into the 'fast' category. There is a quick search bar on the home screen as well as an advanced search tab so you can find the exact recipe you want. Searches can be filtered by type, key ingredient, cooking technique and flavor. If a recipe you want to cook (in the 4000 recipes, there must be something you like) you can add it to the grocery list. This will add every ingredient needed for the recipe to the grocery tab, and will split the items into sections of the supermarket. Items can be added and deleted depending on what you might already have at home and the lists can be emailed for easy sharing or printing. Items can be ticked off from within the app so this can be used while you are shopping.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/d76f2932b4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Found the recipe you want? Got all your ingredients? Time for a bit of cooking. Each recipe has four tabs; overview, ingredients, steps and variations. The overview tells you a little bit about the dish and offers related content such as '14 ideas for roast chicken.' Each step of a recipe is on a separate page, accessible from the numbered buttons at the top, to stop you from getting ahead of yourself. The 'variations tab' offers, as you can probably guess, variations of a recipe so instead of olive oil, you might use black beans as a coating. When reading instructions for many recipes, you will see that times are shown in red. Pressing on these brings up a timer preset to the exact time you need. The timer can be minimised and you are free to browse the app or continue cooking until the timer sounds. You can also close the app whilst the time is running, and as long as you reopen before the timer is up, the app will use the last exit time to readjust the timer. Another feature available from the settings is the ability to change the size of the font for recipes.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4bd3061f38.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>How to Cook Everything really does offer recipes for everything from sauces to chicken, soups to desserts, there is a recipe in here to please everyone. The grocery list implementation is fantastic and something that works really well and makes it simple to use the app from the planning stages of a meal, right through shopping, all the way to the end result. The instructions are easy to follow and the built in timer really sets How to Cook Everything ahead of other recipe apps. The kitchen basics section is great for getting you up to scratch on what you might need as well as how you go about preparing specific foods. Most of the how-to's are accompanied by illustrations making it easy to understand exactly how to do something.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>For everything that is good about it, one thing really disappoints me; pictures. Although there are plenty of illustrations for the how-to section, there are no photos of the finished meals which is something I really enjoy about physical cook books. Maybe it's just me, but I like to choose meals based on how nice they looks as well as the actual recipe itself.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>This is without a doubt the best recipe app I have used and for $4.99 this is an absolute must for everyone who cooks; amateurs, students and professional alike will all find something they love about this app. How to Cook Everything isn't just another recipe app; it's your primary tool in your cooking arsenal.</p>\n",

What do you do? Email it to yourself? Bookmark it? Why not convert it to an easier to read format and have a look whenever you're ready? That is exactly what Instapaper Pro does. It allows you do save articles to for access later from the Instapaper website or the iPhone and iPad app. Simply add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks in your browser on your computer or mobile Safari and you're ready to go.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/a51da93125.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Syncs between app and web</li>\n<li>iPhone bookmarklet</li>\n<li>Dark and light themes</li>\n<li>Tilt scrolling</li>\n<li>Saves your place in an article</li>\n<li>Send to Tumblr and Twitter</li>\n<li>Open in Tweetie and Tumblr app</li>\n<li>Email articles</li>\n<li>In app browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started with Instapaper, you first need to create an account. This can either be done in the app, or on the Instapaper website. Once this is done, you need to start adding articles. Articles can be manually added, or added with the bookmarklet. To add the bookmarklet to Safari, go to settings in the app and choose 'install bookmarklet' and follow the instructions. Now whenever you find an article you want to save for later, simply select the bookmarklet from your bookmarks. So now you've added some articles you want to read them, right? Simply press the sync button in the bottom left and all your saved articles will be downloaded to the app. Select an article to read and you will be presented with a stripped down version of the article you saved. Ads, sidebars and other stuff you don't need is taken away, leaving you just the text and images that are relevant.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/b75da18cf2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There are three different methods to navigate through an article; scrolling, pagination and tilt scroll. Scrolling is self explanatory. Pagination allows you to tap the top of an article to go up and the bottom to go down. Tilt scroll (my favourite of the three) lets you tilt your iPhone back and forth to navigate through the article. A quick note on pagination and tilt scroll; you can only have one or the other turned on and not both. When looking at a saved article, you can resize and reformat the text to make it more readable. Options available include font style, two different sizes as well the ability to change the spacing and width of an article. Saved articles can be emailed or share to Twitter and Tumblr. This can either be done through the Instapaper app, or links can be sent directly to the official Tumblr app and, everyone's favourite Twitter app, Tweetie. Sharing can be accessed through the arrow icon in the bottom right which also houses the ability to open the article in the in built browser or Safari. Other feature include swipe to archive, create folders for articles, star articles and a choice of a light or dark interface. All these options can be accessed from the settings page from the main menu. Articles can be send to Instapaper from many Twitter, RSS reader and news apps available in the app store; a list of which is available on the Instapaper website.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/d9958c50c0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Instapaper Pro gives users plenty of options for all aspects of reading articles; navigation, saving and sharing. All options are easily accessible and make perfect sense in terms of where they are located. The in app browser is great for looking at saved articles that couldn't be converted (this happens on a small minority of articles) and the browser gives you the option to see the text-based article or see the original web page. The installation is as easy as it could possibly be, despite the restrictions of Safari when trying to save bookmarklets.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>The design of Instapaper seems a little less polished than some other apps and the 'open in Safari' button takes an extra button press than is necessary. However, this doesn't detract from the usability of the app.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Instapaper Pro is the perfect companion for anyone who spends a lot of time reading articles online. The app is always being improved and the developer works hard to improve through user feedback. The app is a universal app so will work on your iPad as well with all the same features of the iPhone version and then some iPad-specific extras. If you're still not convinced a free version is available in the app store so you can check it out before you buy the full pro version.</p>\n",

    "title": "Review: Qik Video Camera Pro",
    "path": "2010/05/13/review-qik-video.html",
    "content": "<p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9f173c661f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The iPhone camera is severly lacking in features and this applies to the video function as well. If you want to add effects, upload to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, you're going to need an app with a bit more attitude than the standard. Qik Video Camera Pro allows you to shoot video on any model of iPhone including the original. You can add effects, zoom, upload to your computer via wifi, adjust the brightness as well as loads of other features. But is it worth buying if you already have a video recording app? Lets find out.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/24fad57bda.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with 2G, 3G and 3GS</li>\n<li>Upload to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Qik</li>\n<li>Share via SMS or email</li>\n<li>Apply 10 different effects to your videos in real-time</li>\n<li>Overlay a photo on top of a video</li>\n<li>Upload videos already in your camera roll</li>\n<li>WiFi transfer</li>\n<li>Export to camera roll</li>\n<li>Portrait and landscape recording</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The interface for Qik gives you access to all the functions so you can get straight on with recording as soon as the app opens. There's a button to record, access settings, library, zoom and a wheel to select the different available effects. You can also increase or decrease the brightness and zoom in, using the corresponding button on the main record screen. To start recording simple press the red record button and away you go.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/fb05babe35.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you want to add an effect to your video, simply spin the effects wheel above the main navigation bar at the bottom. Effects available include mirror, sepia, black and white and photo overlay. Each effect shows a real-time preview in a small box on the effects wheel for you to see what your video will look like. Effects can be picked before shotting video, or switched during the recording process. Photo overlay is the only exception as this requires you to pick a photo from your camera roll before you start recording. Once you have chosen one, you can erase parts of it so the video shows through simply by running your finger over the image. Once you have recorded your masterpiece you upload it to four different services; Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Qik. Simply hit the library button, choose the video your want to upload and away you go. From here you can also add a title, add the video to your camera roll, delete it or send a link to the video (which will be uploaded to Qik) via email or SMS. When uploading to Qik, you can choose to use an existing account, sign up for a new one or 'auto', which creates a 'tempuser972346' username for you. If social networks aren't your thing, and you just want to save videos to your computer, Qik has wifi sharing. Go into the video details page, turn on wifi access and enter the ip address it gives you into your computer's web browser. Remember, this will only work if your iPhone and your computer are connected to the same wireless network. Qik also gives you the option to automatically upload videos to Qik once they have finished recording, which is great if you're like me and don't want to spend time uploading every time.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/d51193c15f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Qik Video Camera Pro offers a varied amount of options to create the perfect video of your mate looking stupid playing Wii boxing, or whatever you might be recording. The interface is easy to use, if a little cluttered, and there are uploading options aplenty. Qik also allows you to import existing videos and upload to the services offered, so this elminates the need to have a seperate uploading app. The quality of the video produced isn't quite up to the standard the built-in app is, but it is high enough that no one would ever notice (I only know it's lower because the app store description says so).</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>As I said above, the interface seems somewhat cluttered and the effects wheel is slow to respond, even on my 3GS. Also, when uploading videos to services such as Twitter or Facebook, there is no option to add a description or any information about what your uploading. On Twitter, this results in a tweet that is simply a huge url to a video. On Facebook, this isn't a massive issue as you can log in and add the info, but on Twitter, once it's there, it's there. There is no way to upload multiple videos which can make uploading very time consuming and also no option to do more than one service at a time. Another small problem I have is when choosing an image for the photo overlay effect, you only have access to your camera roll and not your entire photo library, which annoying for me as I tend to takes photos off the camera roll and into a proper folder as soon as I sync to iTunes.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Qik Video Camera Pro covers pretty much every function you could need and having the effects to add makes it great fun to use. Depsite the clunkiness of the interface at times, I would highly reccomend this app for anyone who is dissapointed every time they use the standard iPhone video recording, or for anyone who just wants to add a bit of fun to their next YouTube hit.</p>\n",

For a while now there have been a few apps to give you train times but nothing for buses. Until now. NextBuses finds your nearest bus stops, gives you times and allows you to save them as favourites for quick access at a later date.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/fb4c2e7ab7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find bus stops based on your location</li>\n<li>Scheduled and real-time departures</li>\n<li>Search by postcode, city or near to a train station</li>\n<li>Directions of buses shown on each pin</li>\n<li>Dual-pane map and list view</li>\n<li>Save stops as favourites</li>\n<li>Sort by destination or route</li>\n<li>Over 370,000 bus stops covered in England, Wales and Scotland</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you first open NextBuses, you will see a dual-pane view with a map at the top and a list of nearby stops at the bottom. Once the app has pinpointed your location, red pins will be dropped on the map to show you where the nearest stops are. You can press any of the pins to see the name of the stop, the directions of buses from that stop as well as pressing the blue arrow to see departures from that stop.

Select a specific bus and you can choose to show only buses that follow the same route or ones that are going to the same destination. If the city your in has implemented real-time departures, NextBuses will show it. This is indicated by a clock icon next to each entry, as opposed to the pen/paper icon shown for scheduled departures. NextBuses also offers a manual search option to find bus stops by postcode, a specific area or by train station. If you use specific stops on regular basis, you can add them to your favourites by pressing the favourite icon in the top left. These can be accessed, deleted and rearranged from the main menu by pressing the star button. Another great feature is the ability to rename and assign an icon to a favourite. You can choose from 16 different icons including a bus (obviously!), shopping basket and a beer tankard. This makes selecting which favourite you want far easier than if it was just a list.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/251b7fa588.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I can't vouch for all of the UK, but I have used the app all over the city I live in, as well as other places I've been to in the last couple of weeks, and every stop I have wanted times for has had full and correct information. Also, real-time departures are sparse at best where I live, but whenever these were available, NextBuses indicated this. Accessing the information you need in NextBuses is effortless and favourites can be managed quickly and easily, making access to specific stops simple.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>There isn't really anything 'bad' per se about NextBuses but there are a few features I would like to see. The first is the ability to choose to open the app with either the dual-pane view or the favourites, as I constantly find myself going straight to my favourites. The second is the ability to switch between dual-pane, just he map or just the list on the main menu. This would be a great feature to make finding stops easier if you're in an area you know (list view) or somewhere you don't (map view).</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>NextBuses has an easy-to-use interface that's so simple to use and yet gives you all the information you need as quickly as possible. NextBuses is a definite must buy for anyone who frequently travels by bus.</p>\n",

Google Analaytics is a great way to track data from your website and Analytics App allows you to see your Google Analytics stats right from your iPhone. You can see an overview for multiple accounts and sites of today, yesterday, the past month, as well as drill down to specifics such as browser version, OS version and location.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/8a65d533ec.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>55 different reports</li>\n<li>Multiple accounts</li>\n<li>Adsense support</li>\n<li>Secure connection to Google Analytics</li>\n<li>Customisable date range</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first thing you need to do to get to your website stats is input your Google Anlaytics login credentials. Analytics App allows you to access multiple accounts (if you have more than one). Once this is done, your ready to start digging. The main screen will show a list of websites associated with the account you are logged into. Select the website you want to see and you will be presented with a list of three different overview reports to look at; dashboard, today and yesterday. The dashboard shows a line graph of visitors to your site as well as visits, page views, average time on site, bounce rate and average page views. Scrolling down shows details of keywords that got visitors to your site, which pages people have looked at, what a visitors location was, as well as which sites they were on before yours. The today and yesterday overviews show the same stats as the dashboard view, but (obviously) specific to the day they correspond to. From the main screen, you can select specific dates to see stats for, simple by pressing the date button and chooses the time range. Below the overview reports are options for far more specific reports such as visitor location, browser and operating system type and version number, flash version, java enabled, connection speed and many more. These options give you quick access to any data you need and each overview page can be seen by numbers, or by percentage. There are also traffic, content and site search reports; basically anything available on the Google Analytics page, is available in this app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/c0716862e3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics app offers everything the full Google site does, in an easy to use interface. Every bit of information can be swapped between actual numbers and percentages and being able to see information for exact dates is excellent. The yesterday overview report is something that even the Google Analytics page doesn't offer and multiple account support is great for those who are tracking more than one site.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/b0d53d6d78.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Although you have access to everything you need with Analytics App, getting to it can be slow. After the initial loading of your account, selecting a report will cause the app to start loading the stats. Obviously, I realise the app need to load the information, but it would be far better if data was loaded on startup rather than for each report. Switching between different reports becomes tedious very quickly, especially if you're on a slow network. Also, there is only one graph ever shown and that is on the overview report. I would like to be able to see more specific graphs and charts, like you can on the Google Analytics site.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Despite the slow loading times for some reports, Analytics App is a great tool for anyone who tracks visitors to their website with Google Analytics. Analytics App offers more reports than any other app available, including the Google Analytics website. A bit pricier than many apps on the app store, but worth every penny if it's something you'll use on a regular basis.</p>\n",

Would you like to easily know how many times you've been mentioned in tweets? Birdbrain gives you all of this and more. Followers, retweets, mentioned, blocked and more can be tracked from within Birdbrain. You can get an overview of changes over days, weeks and months to make sure you know exactly what's going on with your 140 character ramblings.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6efd19cdbb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview of following, followers, tweets, mentions, retweets and blocked users</li>\n<li>See changes over 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30, 60 and 90 days and 6 months</li>\n<li>Pull down to refresh</li>\n<li>Multiple accounts</li>\n<li>View the timeline of users</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://Favstar.fm\">Favstar.fm</a> support</li>\n<li>Block/follow/unfollow users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you first open Birdbrain you will see your summary page with stats from your account. Birdbrain has four main tabs as well as a more tab. The first is the summary, or overview page. From here you can see how many followers you have, how many you are following as well as other information. If there has been a change to any of the data in the last 24 hours, Birdbrain will indicate this. Swiping to the left or right will bring up different overviews (e.g. in the last 30 days). There a five of these pages ranging from 24 hours to 6 months. It is important to note that when you first install birdbrain, there will be no changes shown as the app only uses data that has been download through the app. So, the longer you use the app, the more data you will be able to view. The next tab is the followers tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/ae3950fe73.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>From here you can see a list of your followers with either a plus or minus symbols indicating whether they are new followers, or if they have stopped following you. The list is also split into groups depending on when you last accessed Birdbrain and if new follower information was available. The following and mentions tabs show a similar list as the followers tab and, as with followers, you can see more about a user simply by selecting their name from the list. As if you thought that was enough twitter data, going into the more tab allows you to dig even deeper into your account. Want to know who you're following but doesn't follow you? Vice versa? Birdbrain has pages for that. Blocked, retweeted, and specific users can all be accessed from here as well. When you are in any list view, you can select a user to go to a user view page. From here four indicator 'lights' will tell you if they follow you, if you follow them, if their tweets are protected, if you have blocked them as various other information about them. Pressing the settings button in the top right allows you to block, report, follow or unfollow a user as well as view their TwitPic or <a href=\"http://Favstar.fm\">Favstar.fm</a> profile. Also, any of the lists can be refreshed using the Tweetie-inspired pull-down-to-refresh.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6837427120.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Birdbrain offers everything you need to know about your Twitter account in an incredibly beautiful way. Information is easy to access and the overview pages make it simple to spot changes in your account. Birdbrain really comes into it's own once you have used it for a while, so data can build up. Being able to see how many times you have tweeted in the last 6 months, or how many extra people you are following is great.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>Birdbrain is so good it's hard to pinpoint any bad points. However, there are a few things I would like to mention. Firstly, there is no support for lists, which considering it's a relatively new feature, is understandable. Saying this, I would like to see this functionality. Secondly, there is no way to change which tabs are accessible from the navigation bar. I would like, for example, to be able to have quicker access to retweets rather than mentions.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Birdbrain makes everything from retweets to blocked users easy to view and manage and I'm sure, at it has with me, it'll become one of your most used apps. In summary; if you like stats and you use Twitter, you need Birdbrain. No doubt about it.</p>\n",

    "title": "Review: Wolfram Alpha",
    "path": "2010/04/13/review-wolfram-alpha.html",
    "content": "<p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/672f11b0da.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Ever since WolframAlpha realized their $50 mistake and <a href=\"https://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/04/wolframalpha-popular-2/\">dropped the price of their iPhone app</a> to $2, it has shot into the app store top 25. They even offered those who purchased it at the higher price refunds. Now that WolfrramAlpha is actually affordable, this seemed like as good a time as any to review it. WolframAlpha offers a multitude of functions including plotting graphs, calculations and getting data for just about anything. It might be affordable now, but do you really need it? Lets find out.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4c78b022ba.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Listing features for WolframAlpha is difficult for one reason: it does everything. And I mean everything. It's a calculator. It's a music database. Encyclopaedia. Stock tracker. Dictionary. Currency converter. You get the idea. You name it, WolframAlpha does it. I honestly couldn't go through everything WolframAlpha does, so rather, I'll go through how to use it. First off, WolframAlpha isn't search engine. 'How do I change the background color of my website?' as a search term just isn't going to cut it. But, 'HTML Pink' will show you the hex code, RGB code, complementary colors for pink and other shades of pink. Make sense? WolframAlpha gives information and data rather than links to web pages. WolframAlpha has a custom keyboard for searching which includes the standard qwerty keyboard as well as numbers and symbols above that. This gives you quick access to symbols that you would normally have to press the '123' button to get to. Once you have got the data you were looking for, your results are shown and they will likely include (depending on the data required) charts, graphs, tables, maps and images. You can expand most sections of the data to see more information and access similar data.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/7e515b28c9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Everything on the page is rendered as an image which can be saved to the camera roll, copied, shared on Twitter or emailed. You can also copy text from within an image for easy attaching to an email or sms. You can use data from a result as your next search, or 'input'. Similar to clicking on links to Wikipedia, you'll end up looking at data nothing to do with what you starting with (Six Degrees of WolframAlpha, anyone?). WolframAlpha also allows you to open results in Safari, add a specific search to favorites for easy access later as well as use an in-app browser to find out more about a specific subject.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4b83bb26f0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>WolframAlpha's interface is simply beautiful and it seems every little detail has been thought out carefully. Having a custom keyboard is a great idea that I think more apps should use. Loading times are fasts, there are plenty of examples to get you started and data can be shared quickly and easily. The in-app browser makes it easy to find out more information about a subject and favorites is organize in the same way as Safari for quick access to a subject.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst using WolframAlpha I only came across one issue. If you use it for an extended period of time, sections of results from previous searches sometimes become overlaid across the new results which can be fixed by restarting the app. This doesn't cause a massive issue but is annoying nevertheless.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>As I said at the beginning of this review, WolframAlpha really does everything. Whether you're a mathematician looking for a graphing calculator, a scientist looking for detailed chemical formulas or just someone who is constantly looking up facts and statistics, WolframAlpha has you covered. And at the new low price of $1.99 this app is a must buy.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/72589b0cb2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>When it comes to camera features, the iPhone's is severely lacking. No zoom, no timer, no effects. But there are loads of different apps that give you this functionality, but most only offer one or two extra features. Camera One offers them all. Self timer, tap to focus, zoom, grid view and voice shutter are just a few of Camera One's features. But would you be better off getting a couple of dedicated apps thinking about quality over quantity? Let's find out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/7147b58224.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tap to focus (3GS only)</li>\n<li>Big shutter button</li>\n<li>4x Digital zoom</li>\n<li>Colour effects</li>\n<li>Self timer</li>\n<li>Anti shake</li>\n<li>Voice shutter</li>\n<li>Timestamping</li>\n<li>Grid view</li>\n<li>Save directly to camera roll</li>\n<li>Email photos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main screen of Camera One shows the shutter button, camera roll access button and a navigation bar across the top for turning different features on and off. As default digital zoom is turned on and this is shown with a slider bar above the shutter button. Zoom is just one of the features of Camera One and as the name 'ALL-IN-1' suggests, Camera One has pretty much every feature you could ever want, so lets see what else is on offer. Each feature has its own icon on the top navigation bar, the first of which is the zoom. The next is the 'flash' function. This is supposed to improve photos taken in low light but I really couldn't see any difference in the photos dispute what the screenshots on the app store show. There are two colour effects available which can be toggled from the paint tube icon; black and white, and sepia, although the effect isn't shown whilst taking the photo, only once it has been saved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6651736a10.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Self timer is something that many camera apps offer and Camera One is no different; you can choose a 2, 5 or 10 second delay before a photo is taken (although how anyone is managing to balance their iPhone to use self timer is beyond me). For those who find the iPhone's default camera button to be a bit small and difficult to use efficiently, the big button option in Camera One might help. Enabling this allows you to press anywhere on the screen to take a photo. Blur is the curse of any photo. With Camera One's anti-shake feature the likelihood of blurry photos is greatly reduced. With anti-shake turned on, a photo won't be taken until the camera is steady. This is indicated by coloured lines either side of the shutter button, which will disappear once the iPhone is perfectly still. Once of the best features about Camera One is the voice shutter. Enable this option, press the shutter button and a photo will be taken when the app registers a certain level of noise (say cheese!). Camera One also offers a grid view which shows an indicator of the centre of the photo for capturing subjects in perfect position. Other features include the ability to email photos, adding timestamps to photos, choosing the output size and tapping to focus on a specific area (3GS only).</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4baa8f1e81.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;You only need Camera One&quot; is the claim on the splash screen and this is definitely true. Camera One has every feature of every other camera app all rolled into one. Features can easily be toggled on and off and loading times are quick enough for this to be used as a replacement to the iPhone's standard camera app. Sharing photos is quick and easy with the built-in email function and you can also view photos at full resolution rather than scaled to fit the iPhone screen.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>Camera One offers the most features of any camera app but I find the interface lacks polish. Trying to work out which icons correspond to which feature can be difficult and but there is an explanation of each function in the help section of the settings. The other issue I have is with the 'flash' function. In various different light conditions I couldn't see any improvement in the photos. This is disappointing seeing as the iPhone doesn't have a flash, and if this worked, it would be invaluable.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>If you feel, like most of us do, that the iPhone's camera app just doesn't cut it then you'd be smart to spend your money on Camera One rather than loads of different single-function apps. Despite some of the issues I've mentioned, Camera One offers everything you could need to take the perfect picture and for $0.99 this app is more than a bargain.</p>\n",

If this is the case, then Ego is definitely the app for you. Ego lets you see an overview of your stats from Twitter, Google Analytics and more.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/879b919ad7.jpg\" alt=\"\">]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have multiple accounts from the same network</li>\n<li>See stats for;</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Ember</li>\n<li>Feedburner</li>\n<li>Google Analytics</li>\n<li>Mint</li>\n<li>SquareSpace</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started with Ego, you need to add some of your accounts. Press the settings icon and choose the type of account you want to add. Input your credentials, and if available, give the account a memorable name (such as your website name). Once this is done, you're ready to check out your stats. The main screen of Ego shows a widget for each of your added accounts, which is coloured depending on the type of account (e.g. the Feedburner widget is red). You can press each widget to get different information depending on the type of account it is and I will go through most of them (I don't have a Mint or Squarespace account) here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/61bc156958.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The three 'social' types accounts you can add are Twitter, Vimeo and Ember. The Twitter widget, shown in dark blue, shows your most recent tweet and how many followers you have. You can also see how many people you follow and how many tweets you have...errr...tweeted. Vimeo's widget shows how many times your videos have been played, how many people follow you and the amount of comments and likes you have. Finally the Ember widget will display how many photos you have uploaded, as well as following and follower totals. Now onto some slightly more 'professional' services. Put your Feedburner credentials in to see how many subscribers you have as well as how many more subscribers you have gained or lost in the last 24 hours. If you have gained or lost any, this is indicated by a green arrow to the right of the widget. If you use Google Analytics to track visitors to your blog or website, Ego has you covered. Pageviews and visits for the past day, week, month and year can been seen from the orange-coloured widget. As I said above, I don't have a Mint or Squarespace account, but if you do, both of these widgets will show you visits and pageviews in a similar vein to the Google Analytics widget. The order of your widgets can be changed through the settings app as well as giving custom names to some of the services.</p>\n<h2>The Breakdown</h2>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9053eeddff.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Ego is a great app for giving you an overview of your stats in the order you choose. The different colours make it easy to distinguish between each service and adding or removing accounts is easy. Also, the interface for Ego is beautiful and really shows how apps should be made.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\n<p>I really like Ego but there are a couple of small things that can be annoying. Firstly, I would like to be able to choose what I am shown first for each widget (e.g. show pageviews this week rather than today). With some of the website analytic services, stats can take up to 24 hours to update, so being able to see stats for a different period as default would be great. Another problem that I feel would affect many users, including myself, is the lack of support for YouTube. Ego offers stats for Vimeo but not YouTube, and as we all know, the latter is far more popular and I feel this would increase the appeal of the app to a larger audience.</p>\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n<p>Although there is only Vimeo support for video sharing services, I like Ego so much that I am considering moving over to this from YouTube (hence the lack of stats for the Vimeo widget in the screenshots). Ego, for the most part, is aimed at webmasters, who are notoriously obsessed with stats, but even if you only use one or more of the services on offer (who isn't on Twitter these days?), Ego is definitely an app worth buying.</p>\n",
